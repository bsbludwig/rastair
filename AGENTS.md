# What is Rastair?

Rastair is a CLI application written in Rust that allows
the simultaneous detection of genetic variants and methylated positions
from short-read sequencing data created using the TAPS method.

## Methylation and variant calling

TAPS converts methylated C to T, while unmethylated C is converted to U and then read as C.
Thus, methylation is evidenced by having a C reference position show T reads on the OT strand, G refs show A reads on OB strand.
In addition, de-novo CpG postions are possible when X->C or X->G SNPs occur.
Variant calling is complicated by the fact that C->T and G->A SNPs are confounded with methylation.

Rastair uses a combination of thresholding and machine learning to determine true variants.
Rastair's main feature is `call` which processes pileup data
in multiple steps and produces VCF records with variant and methylation calls.
Rastair uses htslib via rust-htslib for reading/writing BAM and VCF/BCF files.

## Structure

Rastair is structured as a CLI application using `clap` for argument parsing.
The main functionality is implemented in the `rastair` crate,
with submodules for different components like pileup processing, variant calling, and methylation analysis.
The `xtask` crate is used for auxiliary tasks like testing and benchmarking.

The core processing pipeline is implemented in `src/call.rs` in the `process_region` function, which processes pileups through several stages:
calculate pileup metrics → set de-novo adjacency flags → add ML metrics → apply threshold filters → propagate de-novo pass flags → set alt calls → estimate genotype → call methylation.
Methylation calling logic is in `src/metrics/methylation.rs` with separate functions for reference C/G positions (`ref_c`, `ref_g`) and de-novo CpG creation (`ref_t_to_c`, `ref_a_to_g`, etc.).
Genotype estimation happens before methylation calling in `src/call/variant_calling/genotype.rs`.
The results are stored in `PileupMetrics.pos_metrics.extended.genotype` and `.methylated`.

# Rust coding guidelines

Rust code is to be written in expert-level Rust. Use the most modern features and idioms.
Specific adn well-named types are the main way to ensure correctness and introduce abstraction.

## General style

* Prioritize code correctness and clarity. Speed and efficiency are secondary priorities unless otherwise specified.
* Do not write organizational comments or ones that summarize the code.
  * Comments should only be written in order to explain "why" the code is written in some way in the case there is a reason that is tricky / non-obvious.
  * In doc comments, do not write parameters and return type sections. Only add susprising constraints.
* Prefer implementing functionality in existing files unless it is a new logical component. Avoid creating many small files.
* Never use files with `mod.rs` paths - modules are always in `src/some_module.rs` instead of `src/some_module/mod.rs`.
* Avoid creative additions unless explicitly requested

## Error handling and logging

* Model the full error space—no shortcuts or simplified error handling. Use the type system to encode correctness constraints. Prefer compile-time guarantees over runtime checks where possible.
* Use `color_eyre` for error handling and reporting 
* Avoid using functions that panic like `unwrap()`, instead use mechanisms like `?` to propagate errors.
* Don't use indexing operations, prefer methods like `get()` that return `Option` types.
* If you can't ensure correctness via the type system, use `ensure!` or `bail!` macros from `color_eyre` to handle unexpected states.
* Never silently discard errors with `let _ =` on fallible operations. Always handle errors appropriately:
  - Propagate errors with `?` when the calling function should handle them
  - Call `warn!(?error, "<what went wrong>")` or similar when you need to ignore errors but want visibility
  - Use explicit error handling with `match` or `if let Err(...)` when you need custom logic
* Use `tracing` for logging

## Testing

* Write comprehensive unit tests for the most critical and complex parts of the codebase when you either add them or encounter bugs in them
* Write integration tests for critical workflows and components, e.g. like the ones in `tests/call_cli.rs`
* Run the tests with `cargo test`.
* Use `cargo xtask insta` to run tests and update any snapshot tests. You need to verify the updated content is correct!

### VCF Tests

VCF tests are in `src/call/tests/vcf_tests/` with separate modules for different scenarios (cpgs.rs, denovo.rs, basic.rs).
Tests use the `pileups!` macro to create synthetic read data with format `[base1 base2 ...] Strand`, and `vcf_assert!` macro to check expected VCF output with format `(Ref Alt...) PASS/FAIL Field=value`.
Test utilities in `src/call/tests/utils.rs` provide the `pileups!` macro for creating test data, and helper functions like `set_pass`/`set_fail` for modifying alt calls with ML scores.
The `reprocess()` function recalculates methylation_strand_info, genotypes, alt calls, and methylation values after modifications.

## BAM rewriting

The BAM rewrite pipeline is in `src/bam.rs` with tag generation in `src/bam/base_modification.rs`.
There are two modes: `legacy` (XR/XG/XM tags, SEQ unchanged) and `standard` (MM/ML tags, SEQ rewritten T→C / A→G).

Critical invariant: **XM and MM/ML tags encode per-read methylation**, not position-level calls.
A CpG with beta=0.3 (`methylated: false` in `RastairCall`) still has individually methylated reads
that must show `Z` in XM and appear in MM/ML. The `methylated` field in `RastairCall::Cpg` only
controls whether the position is recognized as a CpG site, not whether individual reads are methylated.
Per-read methylation is determined solely by the observed base: T at OT C = methylated, A at OB G = methylated.

### MM/ML vs XM paired-read asymmetry

MM/ML tags only encode modifications at C bases in the stored SEQ. For paired reads overlapping a CpG,
only one mate has C at that position (the other has G on the complementary strand). XM tags annotate
both mates. This means tools reading MM/ML (like modkit) see roughly half the reads that XM-based
counting does. Methylation **fractions** agree, but exact counts differ ~2:1.

When comparing legacy (XM) and standard (MM/ML) output, always compare fractions, not absolute counts,
and require minimum coverage to avoid noise at low-coverage positions.

### External tool tests

Tests are in `tests/bam_external_tools.rs` behind `--features external-tool-tests`.
Run in Docker: `docker build -f Dockerfile.external-tool-tests -t rastair-ext-tests . && docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/rastair" rastair-ext-tests`

Cross-validation tests use `RASTAIR_TEST_MIN_COVERAGE` env var (default 5) to set the minimum read
coverage at a position before comparing fractions between tools. Lower values check more positions
but are noisier due to paired-read asymmetry.

# Interactivity guidelines

When you are asked to implement something, always ask for clarifications if needed.
If you are unsure about the requirements, ask for more details.
If you think there is a better way to implement something, suggest it and explain your reasoning, but don't implement it immediately without approval.

# Keep this updated

**Important:** Whenever you learned something new about how to develop features, find code, or how to debug issues, you **must** add it to this document.
This is the single source of truth for how to work on this codebase, and it must be kept up-to-date with any new insights or changes.
If you find yourself asking "How do I do X?" and you figure it out, add a section here so that the next person doesn't have to ask the same question.
